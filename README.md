# Digital Library Project

## Description
This project aims to create a digital library where users can manage their book collections. 
The library allows users to list books, add new books, remove books, and search for books by title.

## Features
- **List Books:** View the list of books in your library.
- **Add Books:** Add new books to your library.
- **Remove Books:** Remove existing books from your library.
- **Search Books:** Search for books by title.

## Future Enhancements
I do plan on adding these enhancement to the project later on

- **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication to allow
multiple users to manage their own libraries securely.
- **Responsive Design:** Make the website responsive to
ensure a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
